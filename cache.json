One of the\ncomputational bottleneck comes from computing attention over a long sequence of\ninput at each generation step. In this paper, we propose Recycled Attention, an\ninference-time method which alternates between full context attention and\nattention over a subset of input tokens. When performing partial attention, we\nrecycle the attention pattern of a previous token that has performed full\nattention and attend only to the top K most attended tokens, reducing the cost\nof data movement and attention computation. Compared to previously proposed\ninference-time acceleration method which attends only to local context or\ntokens with high accumulative attention scores, our approach flexibly chooses\ntokens that are relevant to the current decoding step. We evaluate our methods\non RULER, a suite of tasks designed to comprehensively evaluate long-context\nabilities, and long-context language modeling tasks. Applying our method to\noff-the-shelf LLMs achieves comparable speedup to baselines which only consider\nlocal context while improving the performance by 2x.

Prior work has proposed a diverse\nset of methods to efficiently learn mixture proportions, ranging from fitting\nregression models over training runs to dynamically updating proportions\nthroughout training.

We find that existing parameterizations of mixing laws can\nexpress the true loss-proportion relationship empirically, but the methods\nthemselves often set the mixing law parameters inaccurately, resulting in poor\nand inconsistent performance. Finally, we leverage the insights from our\nframework to derive a new online method named Aioli, which directly estimates\nthe mixing law parameters throughout training and uses them to dynamically\nadjust proportions. Empirically, Aioli outperforms stratified sampling on 6 out\nof 6 datasets by an average of 0.28 test perplexity points, whereas existing\nmethods fail to consistently beat stratified sampling, doing up to 6.9 points\nworse.

Recently, there has been considerable interest in increasing the\ncontext lengths for these models to enhance their applicability to complex\ntasks. However, at long context lengths and large batch sizes, the key-value\n(KV) cache, which stores the attention keys and values, emerges as the new\nbottleneck in memory usage during inference. To address this, we propose Eigen\nAttention, which performs the attention operation in a low-rank space, thereby\nreducing the KV cache memory overhead.

While their fluency\nacross a variety of domains is impressive, modern AI systems fall short on\ntests requiring symbolic processing and abstraction - a glaring limitation\ngiven the necessity for interpretable and reliable technology. Despite a surge\nof reasoning benchmarks emerging from the academic community, no comprehensive\nand theoretically-motivated framework exists to quantify reasoning (and more\ngenerally, symbolic ability) in AI systems. Here, we adopt a framework from\ncomputational complexity theory to explicitly quantify symbolic generalization:\nalgebraic circuit complexity. Many symbolic reasoning problems can be recast as\nalgebraic expressions. Thus, algebraic circuit complexity theory - the study of\nalgebraic expressions as circuit models (i.e., directed acyclic graphs) - is a\nnatural framework to study the complexity of symbolic computation. The tools of\nalgebraic circuit complexity enable the study of generalization by defining\nbenchmarks in terms of their complexity-theoretic properties (i.e., the\ndifficulty of a problem). Moreover, algebraic circuits are generic mathematical\nobjects; for a given algebraic circuit, an arbitrarily large number of samples\ncan be generated for a specific circuit, making it an optimal testbed for the\ndata-hungry machine learning algorithms that are used today.

Thus, the noisy information from unreliable\nneighbor nodes (e.g., users with dissimilar interests) negatively impacts the\nrepresentation learning of the target node. Additionally, conducting graph\nconvolution operations without differentiating high-order neighbors suffers the\nover-smoothing issue when stacking more layers, resulting in performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we aim to capture more valuable information from\nhigh-order neighboring nodes while avoiding noise for better representation\nlearning of the target node. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel GCN-based\nrecommendation model, termed Cluster-based Graph Collaborative Filtering\n(ClusterGCF). This model performs high-order graph convolution on\ncluster-specific graphs, which are constructed by capturing the multiple\ninterests of users and identifying the common interests among them.\nSpecifically, we design an unsupervised and optimizable soft node clustering\napproach to classify user and item nodes into multiple clusters.

To overcome this limitation, we propose SVDQuant, a new 4-bit\nquantization paradigm.

To investigate the key\nfactors influencing real-world deployment and to encourage original solutions\nfrom different researchers, we organized the Robot Air Hockey Challenge at the\nNeurIPS 2023 conference.

Since human annotation is costly,\nwe further propose a semi-supervised version, $\\texttt{SGen}^{\\texttt{Semi}}$,\nwhich fully utilizes the unlabeled data by pseudo-labeling, leveraging an\nentailment set function learned via conformal prediction. Furthermore,\n$\\texttt{SGen}^{\\texttt{Semi}}$ enables to use more general class of selection\nfunctions, neuro-selection functions, and provides users with an optimal\nselection function class given multiple candidates. Finally, we demonstrate the\nefficacy of the $\\texttt{SGen}$ family in achieving a desired FDR-E level with\ncomparable selection efficiency to those from baselines on both open and closed\nsource GLMs. Code and datasets are provided at\nhttps://github.com/ml-postech/selective-generation.\n","authors":["Minjae Lee","Kyungmin Kim","Taesoo Kim","Sangdon Park"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09254v2.pdf","comment":"10 pages"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07909v3","updated":"2024-11-08T06:19:33Z","published":"2023-03-14T13:49:54Z","title":"Text-to-image Diffusion Models in Generative AI: A Survey","summary":"  This survey reviews the progress of diffusion models in generating images\nfrom text, ~\\textit{i.e.} text-to-image diffusion models.

In positron emission tomography\n(PET), the reduction in tracer dose leads to information loss in sino-grams.\nUsing diffusion models to reconstruct missing in-formation can improve imaging\nquality. Traditional diffu-sion models effectively use Gaussian noise for image\nre-constructions. However, in low-dose PET reconstruction, Gaussian noise can\nworsen the already sparse data by introducing artifacts and inconsistencies. To\naddress this issue, we propose a diffusion model named residual esti-mation\ndiffusion (RED).

It can minimize cyber attacks and\nprevent frauds, specially those associated with identity theft. A particular\ninterest lies on keystroke dynamics (KD), which refers to the task of\nrecognizing individuals' identity based on their unique typing style. In this\nwork, we propose the use of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to recognize\nsuch patterns. Although PLMs have shown high performance on multiple NLP\nbenchmarks, the use of these models on specific tasks requires customization.\nBERT and RoBERTa, for instance, rely on subword tokenization, and they cannot\nbe directly applied to KD, which requires temporal-character information to\nrecognize users. Recent character-aware PLMs are able to process both subwords\nand character-level information and can be an alternative solution.\nNotwithstanding, they are still not suitable to be directly fine-tuned for KD\nas they are not optimized to account for user's temporal typing information\n(e.g., hold time and flight time). To overcome this limitation, we propose\nTempCharBERT, an architecture that incorporates temporal-character information\nin the embedding layer of CharBERT. This allows modeling keystroke dynamics for\nthe purpose of user identification and authentication. Our results show a\nsignificant improvement with this customization.

The attention head can\nsimultaneously delete, copy, or retain tokens by assigning them negative,\npositive, or minimal attention weights, respectively. As a result, a single\nattention head becomes more flexible and expressive. (2) Cog Attention improves\nthe model's robustness against representational collapse, which can occur when\nearlier tokens are over-squashed into later positions, leading to homogeneous\nrepresentations.

Therefore, fine-tuning on specialized or new knowledge that\nreflects changes in the world has become popular, though it risks disrupting\nthe model's original capabilities. We study this fragility in the context of\ncontinual memorization, where the model is trained on a small set of long-tail\nfactoids (factual associations) and must retain these factoids after multiple\nstages of subsequent training on other datasets. Through extensive experiments,\nwe show that LLMs suffer from forgetting across a wide range of subsequent\ntasks, and simple replay techniques do not fully prevent forgetting, especially\nwhen the factoid datasets are trained in the later stages. We posit that there\nare two ways to alleviate forgetting: 1) protect the memorization process as\nthe model learns the factoids, or 2) reduce interference from training in later\nstages. With this insight, we develop an effective mitigation strategy: REMIX\n(Random and Generic Data Mixing). REMIX prevents forgetting by mixing generic\ndata sampled from pretraining corpora or even randomly generated word sequences\nduring each stage, despite being unrelated to the memorized factoids in the\nfirst stage. REMIX can recover performance from severe forgetting, often\noutperforming replay-based methods that have access to the factoids from the\nfirst stage. We then analyze how REMIX alters the learning process and find\nthat successful forgetting prevention is associated with a pattern: the model\nstores factoids in earlier layers than usual and diversifies the set of layers\nthat store these factoids.

Therefore, they may fall short when\nevaluating models' global context understanding capacity, such as synthesizing\nand reasoning over content across input to generate the response. In this\npaper, we study long-context language model (LCLM) evaluation through many-shot\nin-context learning (ICL). Concretely, we identify the skills each ICL task\nrequires, and examine models' long-context capabilities on them. We first ask:\nWhat types of ICL tasks benefit from additional demonstrations, and are these\ntasks effective at evaluating LCLMs? We find that classification and\nsummarization tasks show notable performance improvements with additional\ndemonstrations, while translation and reasoning tasks do not exhibit clear\ntrends. This suggests the classification tasks predominantly test models'\nretrieval skills. Next, we ask: To what extent does each task require retrieval\nskills versus global context understanding from LCLMs? We develop metrics to\ncategorize ICL tasks into two groups: (i) retrieval tasks that require strong\nretrieval ability to pinpoint relevant examples, and (ii) global context\nunderstanding tasks that necessitate a deeper comprehension of the full input.\nWe find that not all datasets can effectively evaluate these long-context\ncapabilities.

The HiDR module unifies hyper-relational KGs, temporal KGs, and nested\nfactual KGs into triple-based representations. Then HiSL incorporates\nintra-fact and inter-fact message passing, focusing on enhancing the semantic\ninformation within individual facts and enriching the structural information\nbetween facts. Experimental results across 7 datasets from 3 types of KGs\ndemonstrate that our UniHR outperforms baselines designed for one specific kind\nof KG, indicating strong generalization capability of HiDR form and the\neffectiveness of HiSL module.

Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent\nfeature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On\nthe other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the\nsimilarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural\nsparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual\nwords. However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no\nground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex\ndesign to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more\ninterpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for\nboth modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for\nits local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to\nleverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the false\ndiscovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation\nfrom falsely frequently activating meaningless words. We demonstrate that these\ntwo pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on the\nmodest multi-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On\ncross-modal retrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal\ndataset, outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M)\nand those trained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data,\nincluding CC-12M).

Notably, the success rate of 78.0\\% on GPT-4 with merely 15 queries\nsurpassed previous art by 33.1\\%.

Choosing how sensitive the model is to\nits context is a fundamental functionality, as it enables the model to excel at\ntasks like retrieval-augmented generation and question-answering. In this\npaper, we search for a knob which controls this sensitivity, determining\nwhether language models answer from the context or their prior knowledge. To\nguide this search, we design a task for controllable context sensitivity. In\nthis task, we first feed the model a context (Paris is in England) and a\nquestion (Where is Paris?); we then instruct the model to either use its prior\nor contextual knowledge and evaluate whether it generates the correct answer\nfor both intents (either France or England).

An intelligent system should perform set operations\nconsistently, regardless of superficial variations in the operands. Initially\ndesigned for semantically-oriented NLP tasks, large language models (LLMs) are\nnow being evaluated on algorithmic tasks. Because sets are comprised of\narbitrary symbols (e.g. numbers, words), they provide an opportunity to test,\nsystematically, the invariance of LLMs' algorithmic abilities under simple\nlexical or semantic variations. To this end, we present the SetLexSem\nChallenge, a synthetic benchmark that evaluates the performance of LLMs on set\noperations. SetLexSem assesses the robustness of LLMs' instruction-following\nabilities under various conditions, focusing on the set operations and the\nnature and construction of the set members. Evaluating seven LLMs with\nSetLexSem, we find that they exhibit poor robustness to variation in both\noperation and operands. We show -- via the framework's systematic sampling of\nset members along lexical and semantic dimensions -- that LLMs are not only not\nrobust to variation along these dimensions but demonstrate unique failure modes\nin particular, easy-to-create semantic groupings of \"deceptive\" sets. We find\nthat rigorously measuring language model robustness to variation in frequency\nand length is challenging and present an analysis that measures them\nindependently.

One major question is whether these\nmodels \"memorize\" all their training data or they integrate many data sources\nin some way more akin to how a human would learn and synthesize information.\nThe answer hinges, to a large degree, on how we define memorization. In this\nwork, we propose the Adversarial Compression Ratio (ACR) as a metric for\nassessing memorization in LLMs. A given string from the training data is\nconsidered memorized if it can be elicited by a prompt (much) shorter than the\nstring itself -- in other words, if these strings can be \"compressed\" with the\nmodel by computing adversarial prompts of fewer tokens. The ACR overcomes the\nlimitations of existing notions of memorization by (i) offering an adversarial\nview of measuring memorization, especially for monitoring unlearning and\ncompliance; and (ii) allowing for the flexibility to measure memorization for\narbitrary strings at a reasonably low compute. Our definition serves as a\npractical tool for determining when model owners may be violating terms around\ndata usage, providing a potential legal tool and a critical lens through which\nto address such scenarios.\n","authors":["Avi Schwarzschild","Zhili Feng","Pratyush Maini","Zachary C.

A\ntypical RAG implementation uses powerful retrieval models to extract external\ninformation and large language models (LLMs) to generate answers. In contrast,\nrecent LLM-based retrieval has gained attention for its substantial\nimprovements in information retrieval (IR) due to the LLMs' semantic\nunderstanding capability. However, directly applying LLM to RAG systems\npresents challenges. This may cause feature locality problems as massive\nparametric knowledge can hinder effective usage of global information across\nthe corpus; for example, an LLM-based retriever often inputs document summaries\ninstead of full documents. Moreover, various pre-trained tasks in LLMs\nintroduce variance, further weakening performance as a retriever.\n  To address these issues, we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning\narchitecture called Invar-RAG.

As an alternative,\nrecent studies have proposed the use of large language models (LLMs) to\ncompletely replace human assessors. However, while LLMs seem to somewhat\ncorrelate with human judgments, they are not perfect and often show bias.\nMoreover, even if a well-performing LLM or prompt is found on one dataset,\nthere is no guarantee that it will perform similarly in practice, due to\ndifference in tasks and data.

The goal of\ndataset condensation is to synthesize a small yet informative dataset, upon\nwhich models can achieve performance comparable to those trained on large\ndatasets. While existing condensation approaches are tailored to classification\ntasks for continuous data like images or embeddings, direct application of them\nto CBR has limitations. To bridge this gap, we investigate efficient dataset\ncondensation for content-based recommendation. Inspired by the remarkable\nabilities of large language models (LLMs) in text comprehension and generation,\nwe leverage LLMs to empower the generation of textual content during\ncondensation. To handle the interaction data involving both users and items, we\ndevise a dual-level condensation method: content-level and user-level. At\ncontent-level, we utilize LLMs to condense all contents of an item into a new\ninformative title. At user-level, we design a clustering-based synthesis\nmodule, where we first utilize LLMs to extract user interests. Then, the user\ninterests and user embeddings are incorporated to condense users and generate\ninteractions for condensed users. Notably, the condensation paradigm of this\nmethod is forward and free from iterative optimization on the synthesized\ndataset. Extensive empirical findings from our study, conducted on three\nauthentic datasets, substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.\nParticularly, we are able to approximate up to 97% of the original performance\nwhile reducing the dataset size by 95% (i.e., on dataset MIND).\n","authors":["Jiahao Wu","Qijiong Liu","Hengchang Hu","Wenqi Fan","Shengcai Liu","Qing Li","Xiao-Ming Wu","Ke Tang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09874v4.pdf","comment":"An updated version"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07439v1","updated":"2024-11-11T23:40:45Z","published":"2024-11-11T23:40:45Z","title":"Music Discovery Dialogue Generation Using Human Intent Analysis and\n  Large Language Models","summary":"  A conversational music retrieval system can help users discover music that\nmatches their preferences through dialogue.

While large language model (LLM) based approaches show promise in\nautomating scientific discovery, they often overlook the importance of\ncriticizing scientific models. Criticizing models deepens scientific\nunderstanding and drives the development of more accurate models. Automating\nmodel criticism is difficult because it traditionally requires a human expert\nto define how to compare a model with data and evaluate if the discrepancies\nare significant--both rely heavily on understanding the modeling assumptions\nand domain. Although LLM-based critic approaches are appealing, they introduce\nnew challenges: LLMs might hallucinate the critiques themselves. Motivated by\nthis, we introduce CriticAL (Critic Automation with Language Models). CriticAL\nuses LLMs to generate summary statistics that capture discrepancies between\nmodel predictions and data, and applies hypothesis tests to evaluate their\nsignificance. We can view CriticAL as a verifier that validates models and\ntheir critiques by embedding them in a hypothesis testing framework. In\nexperiments, we evaluate CriticAL across key quantitative and qualitative\ndimensions. In settings where we synthesize discrepancies between models and\ndatasets, CriticAL reliably generates correct critiques without hallucinating\nincorrect ones. We show that both human and LLM judges consistently prefer\nCriticAL's critiques over alternative approaches in terms of transparency and\nactionability.

While existing\nICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g.,\nx-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on\nunstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks\nlike word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models\ntrained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements\nand training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities can emerge\nsimply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured\ndata; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through\nco-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of\nwords (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms.\nHowever, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks\nrequiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where\nICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new,\nunseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs\nappear only in fixed training positions.

In this work, we investigate whether current\nunlearning methods for LLMs succeed beyond superficial unlearning of facts.\nSpecifically, we formally propose a framework and a definition for deep\nunlearning facts that are interrelated. We design the metric, recall, to\nquantify the extent of deep unlearning. To systematically evaluate deep\nunlearning, we construct a synthetic dataset EDU-RELAT, which consists of a\nsynthetic knowledge base of family relationships and biographies, together with\na realistic logical rule set that connects them. We use this dataset to test\nfour unlearning methods in four LLMs at different sizes. Our findings reveal\nthat in the task of deep unlearning only a single fact, they either fail to\nproperly unlearn with high recall, or end up unlearning many other irrelevant\nfacts. Our dataset and code are publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/wrh14/deep_unlearning.\n","authors":["Ruihan Wu","Chhavi Yadav","Russ Salakhutdinov","Kamalika Chaudhuri"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15153v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04905v2","updated":"2024-11-09T17:33:51Z","published":"2024-11-07T17:47:25Z","title":"OpenCoder: The Open Cookbook for Top-Tier Code Large Language Models","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) for code have become indispensable in various\ndomains, including code generation, reasoning tasks and agent systems. While\nopen-access code LLMs are increasingly approaching the performance levels of\nproprietary models, high-quality code LLMs suitable for rigorous scientific\ninvestigation, particularly those with reproducible data processing pipelines\nand transparent training protocols, remain limited. The scarcity is due to\nvarious challenges, including resource constraints, ethical considerations, and\nthe competitive advantages of keeping models advanced. To address the gap, we\nintroduce OpenCoder, a top-tier code LLM that not only achieves performance\ncomparable to leading models but also serves as an \"open cookbook\" for the\nresearch community. Unlike most prior efforts, we release not only model\nweights and inference code, but also the reproducible training data, complete\ndata processing pipeline, rigorous experimental ablation results, and detailed\ntraining protocols for open scientific research. Through this comprehensive\nrelease, we identify the key ingredients for building a top-tier code LLM: (1)\ncode optimized heuristic rules for data cleaning and methods for data\ndeduplication, (2) recall of text corpus related to code and (3) high-quality\nsynthetic data in both annealing and supervised fine-tuning stages. By offering\nthis level of openness, we aim to broaden access to all aspects of a top-tier\ncode LLM, with OpenCoder serving as both a powerful model and an open\nfoundation to accelerate research, and enable reproducible advancements in code\nAI.\n","authors":["Siming Huang","Tianhao Cheng","J.

To shed light on this, we develop a new notion of sufficient context,\nalong with a way to classify instances that have enough information to answer\nthe query.

Beyond result-level explanations, model-level\ninterpretations can provide valuable insights that allow developers to optimize\nsystem designs and implement targeted improvements. However, most current\napproaches depend on specialized model designs, which often lack generalization\ncapabilities. Given the various kinds of recommendation models, existing\nmethods have limited ability to effectively interpret them. To address this\nissue, we propose RecSAE, an automatic, generalizable probing method for\ninterpreting the internal states of Recommendation models with Sparse\nAutoEncoder. RecSAE serves as a plug-in module that does not affect original\nmodels during interpretations, while also enabling predictable modifications to\ntheir behaviors based on interpretation results. Firstly, we train an\nautoencoder with sparsity constraints to reconstruct internal activations of\nrecommendation models, making the RecSAE latents more interpretable and\nmonosemantic than the original neuron activations. Secondly, we automated the\nconstruction of concept dictionaries based on the relationship between latent\nactivations and input item sequences. Thirdly, RecSAE validates these\ninterpretations by predicting latent activations on new item sequences using\nthe concept dictionary and deriving interpretation confidence scores from\nprecision and recall. We demonstrate RecSAE's effectiveness on two datasets,\nidentifying hundreds of highly interpretable concepts from pure ID-based\nmodels. Latent ablation studies further confirm that manipulating latent\nconcepts produces corresponding changes in model output behavior, underscoring\nRecSAE's utility for both understanding and targeted tuning recommendation\nmodels.

This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies\nanalyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of\nyet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally\nwell be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be\nformalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of\nprior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of\nregularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same\npredictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically\nEnglish adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We\nintroduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs:\nfocusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and\nanalogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a\nset of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct\nconclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and\nanalogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives\nwith regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable\nnominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match.\nFurthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies,\neven for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical\naccount of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the\nhypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization\ninvolves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the\nunderlying mechanism.

This work\naddresses this gap by studying how LLMs acquire factual knowledge during\npretraining. The findings reveal several important insights into the dynamics\nof factual knowledge acquisition during pretraining. First, counterintuitively,\nwe observe that pretraining on more data shows no significant improvement in\nthe model's capability to acquire and maintain factual knowledge. Next, there\nis a power-law relationship between training steps and forgetting of\nmemorization and generalization of factual knowledge, and LLMs trained with\nduplicated training data exhibit faster forgetting. Third, training LLMs with\nlarger batch sizes can enhance the models' robustness to forgetting. Overall,\nour observations suggest that factual knowledge acquisition in LLM pretraining\noccurs by progressively increasing the probability of factual knowledge\npresented in the pretraining data at each step. However, this increase is\ndiluted by subsequent forgetting. Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate\nthat we can provide plausible explanations for recently observed behaviors of\nLLMs, such as the poor performance of LLMs on long-tail knowledge and the\nbenefits of deduplicating the pretraining corpus.\n","authors":["Hoyeon Chang","Jinho Park","Seonghyeon Ye","Sohee Yang","Youngkyung Seo","Du-Seong Chang","Minjoon Seo"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11813v3.pdf","comment":"Accepted at NeurIPS 2024"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06855v2","updated":"2024-11-12T16:03:24Z","published":"2024-11-11T10:37:11Z","title":"A Unified Multi-Task Learning Architecture for Hate Detection Leveraging\n  User-Based Information","summary":"  Hate speech, offensive language, aggression, racism, sexism, and other\nabusive language are common phenomena in social media.

We observe a\nsimilar behavior in large language models (LLMs), which we term \"Verbosity\nCompensation\" (VC). VC is harmful because it confuses the user understanding,\nleading to low efficiency, and influences the LLM services by increasing the\nlatency and cost of generating useless tokens. In this paper, we present the\nfirst work that defines and analyzes Verbosity Compensation, explores its\ncauses, and proposes a simple mitigating approach. We define Verbosity\nCompensation as the behavior of generating responses that can be compressed\nwithout information loss when prompted to write concisely. Our experiments,\nconducted on five datasets of knowledge and reasoning-based QA tasks with 14\nnewly developed LLMs, reveal three conclusions. 1) We reveal a pervasive\npresence of verbosity compensation across all models and all datasets.

Moreover, we analyze differences between human and LLM-generated\nCFs, providing insights for future research directions.

As models scale, compression techniques become essential for\nbalancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning,\nwhich removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy\nfor reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant\nquality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To\nrecover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it\ncan lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data\ndistribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT\nis essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize\nself-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach\nleverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that\npreserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by\nmaintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge.

Researchers have recently\nproposed several multi-modal LLMs in this direction that can achieve\nspeech-to-speech dialogue. This paper proposes a novel speech-text multimodal\nLLM architecture called Freeze-Omni. Our main contribution is that the speech\ninput and output modalities can be easily connected to a textual LLM while\nkeeping the LLM's parameters frozen throughout the training process. We\ndesigned 3-stage training strategies both for the modeling of speech input and\noutput, enabling Freeze-Omni to obtain speech-to-speech dialogue ability using\ntext-speech paired data (such as ASR and TTS data) and only 60,000 multi-round\ntext Q&A data on 8 GPUs. Moreover, we can effectively ensure that the\nintelligence of the Freeze-Omni in the speech modality is at the same level\ncompared with that in the text modality of its backbone LLM, while the\nend-to-end latency of the spoken response achieves a low level. In addition, we\nalso designed a method to achieve duplex dialogue ability through multi-task\ntraining, making Freeze-Omni have a more natural style of dialogue ability\nbetween the users.

However, most existing\ndependency-based approaches ignore the positive influence of the words outside\nthe dependency trees, sometimes conveying rich and useful information on\nrelation extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel model, Entity-aware\nSelf-attention Contextualized GCN (ESC-GCN), which efficiently incorporates\nsyntactic structure of input sentences and semantic context of sequences. To be\nspecific, relative position self-attention obtains the overall semantic\npairwise correlation related to word position, and contextualized graph\nconvolutional networks capture rich intra-sentence dependencies between words\nby adequately pruning operations. Furthermore, entity-aware attention layer\ndynamically selects which token is more decisive to make final relation\nprediction. In this way, our proposed model not only reduces the noisy impact\nfrom dependency trees, but also obtains easily-ignored entity-related semantic\nrepresentation.

To study this problem, we\npropose a new physical reasoning task and a dataset, dubbed TraySim. Our task\ninvolves predicting the dynamics of several objects on a tray that is given an\nexternal impact -- the domino effect of the ensued object interactions and\ntheir dynamics thus offering a challenging yet controlled setup, with the goal\nof reasoning being to infer the stability of the objects after the impact. To\nsolve this complex physical reasoning task, we present LLMPhy, a zero-shot\nblack-box optimization framework that leverages the physics knowledge and\nprogram synthesis abilities of LLMs, and synergizes these abilities with the\nworld models built into modern physics engines. Specifically, LLMPhy uses an\nLLM to generate code to iteratively estimate the physical hyperparameters of\nthe system (friction, damping, layout, etc.) via an implicit\nanalysis-by-synthesis approach using a (non-differentiable) simulator in the\nloop and uses the inferred parameters to imagine the dynamics of the scene\ntowards solving the reasoning task.

This question has attracted considerable attention, with most studies\nanalyzing the extent to which the language skills of LLMs resemble rules. As of\nyet, it is not known whether linguistic generalization in LLMs could equally\nwell be explained as the result of analogical processes, which can be\nformalized as similarity operations on stored exemplars. A key shortcoming of\nprior research is its focus on linguistic phenomena with a high degree of\nregularity, for which rule-based and analogical approaches make the same\npredictions. Here, we instead examine derivational morphology, specifically\nEnglish adjective nominalization, which displays notable variability. We\nintroduce a new method for investigating linguistic generalization in LLMs:\nfocusing on GPT-J, we fit cognitive models that instantiate rule-based and\nanalogical learning to the LLM training data and compare their predictions on a\nset of nonce adjectives with those of the LLM, allowing us to draw direct\nconclusions regarding underlying mechanisms. As expected, rule-based and\nanalogical models explain the predictions of GPT-J equally well for adjectives\nwith regular nominalization patterns. However, for adjectives with variable\nnominalization patterns, the analogical model provides a much better match.\nFurthermore, GPT-J's behavior is sensitive to the individual word frequencies,\neven for regular forms, a behavior that is consistent with an analogical\naccount of regular forms but not a rule-based one. These findings refute the\nhypothesis that GPT-J's linguistic generalization on adjective nominalization\ninvolves rules, suggesting similarity operations on stored exemplars as the\nunderlying mechanism.

Theoretically, DMG\nguarantees better performance than the in-sample optimal policy in the oracle\ngeneralization scenario. Even under worst-case generalization, DMG can still\ncontrol value overestimation at a certain level and lower bound the\nperformance. Empirically, DMG achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nGym-MuJoCo locomotion tasks and challenging AntMaze tasks. Moreover, benefiting\nfrom its flexibility in both generalization aspects, DMG enjoys a seamless\ntransition from offline to online learning and attains strong online\nfine-tuning performance.\n","authors":["Yixiu Mao","Qi Wang","Yun Qu","Yuhang Jiang","Xiangyang Ji"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07934v1.pdf","comment":"Accepted to NeurIPS 2024. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap\n  with arXiv:2410.19400"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07933v1","updated":"2024-11-12T17:04:12Z","published":"2024-11-12T17:04:12Z","title":"Prediction of Acoustic Communication Performance for AUVs using Gaussian\n  Process Classification","summary":"  Cooperating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) often rely on acoustic\ncommunication to coordinate their actions effectively.

However, this task is\ntypically more challenging than other regression tasks due to the censored\nobservations. Moreover, concerns regarding the reliability of predictions\npersist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence\nassessment, robustness, and calibration of prediction. To address those\nchallenges, we introduce an evidential regression model designed especially for\ntime-to-event prediction tasks, with which the most plausible event time, is\ndirectly quantified by aggregated Gaussian random fuzzy numbers (GRFNs). The\nGRFNs are a newly introduced family of random fuzzy subsets of the real line\nthat generalizes both Gaussian random variables and Gaussian possibility\ndistributions. Different from conventional methods that construct models based\non strict data distribution, e.g., proportional hazard function, our model only\nassumes the event time is encoded in a real line GFRN without any strict\ndistribution assumption, therefore offering more flexibility in complex data\nscenarios. Furthermore, the epistemic and aleatory uncertainty regarding the\nevent time is quantified within the aggregated GRFN as well.

To compute such robust\nmemory-based policies, we propose the pessimistic iterative planning (PIP)\nframework, which alternates between two main steps: (1) selecting a pessimistic\n(non-robust) POMDP via worst-case probability instances from the uncertainty\nsets; and (2) computing a finite-state controller (FSC) for this pessimistic\nPOMDP. We evaluate the performance of this FSC on the original robust POMDP and\nuse this evaluation in step (1) to select the next pessimistic POMDP. Within\nPIP, we propose the rFSCNet algorithm. In each iteration, rFSCNet finds an FSC\nthrough a recurrent neural network by using supervision policies optimized for\nthe pessimistic POMDP.

We formalize\nthis via block diagonality conditions on the $(n+1)$th order derivatives of the\ngenerator mapping concepts to observed data, where different orders of\n\"complexity\" correspond to different $n$.

However, these metrics have shown unsatisfactory alignment with GNN\nperformance and have not been effectively employed to guide feature selection\nin GNNs. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel metric, Topological\nFeature Informativeness (TFI), to distinguish between GNN-favored and\nGNN-disfavored features, where its effectiveness is validated through both\ntheoretical analysis and empirical observations. Based on TFI, we propose a\nsimple yet effective Graph Feature Selection (GFS) method, which processes\nGNN-favored and GNN-disfavored features separately, using GNNs and non-GNN\nmodels. Compared to original GNNs, GFS significantly improves the extraction of\nuseful topological information from each feature with comparable computational\ncosts. Extensive experiments show that after applying GFS to 8 baseline and\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN architectures across 10 datasets, 83.75% of the\nGFS-augmented cases show significant performance boosts. Furthermore, our\nproposed TFI metric outperforms other feature selection methods. These results\nvalidate the effectiveness of both GFS and TFI. Additionally, we demonstrate\nthat GFS's improvements are robust to hyperparameter tuning, highlighting its\npotential as a universal method for enhancing various GNN architectures.\n","authors":["Yilun Zheng","Xiang Li","Sitao Luan","Xiaojiang Peng","Lihui Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07663v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13848v2","updated":"2024-11-12T09:21:13Z","published":"2024-03-18T10:44:22Z","title":"Smooth Sensitivity for Learning Differentially-Private yet Accurate Rule\n  Lists","summary":"  Differentially-private (DP) mechanisms can be embedded into the design of a\nmachine learning algorithm to protect the resulting model against privacy\nleakage.

Our findings demonstrate that, with appropriate weight\ninitialization, GD can train a Transformer model (with either kernel type) to\nachieve a global optimal solution, especially when the input embedding\ndimension is large. Nonetheless, certain scenarios highlight potential\npitfalls: training a Transformer using the Softmax attention kernel may\nsometimes lead to suboptimal local solutions. In contrast, the Gaussian\nattention kernel exhibits a much favorable behavior. Our empirical study\nfurther validate the theoretical findings.\n","authors":["Bingqing Song","Boran Han","Shuai Zhang","Jie Ding","Mingyi Hong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07538v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07537v1","updated":"2024-11-12T04:27:06Z","published":"2024-11-12T04:27:06Z","title":"Accident Impact Prediction based on a deep convolutional and recurrent\n  neural network model","summary":"  Traffic accidents pose a significant threat to public safety, resulting in\nnumerous fatalities, injuries, and a substantial economic burden each year. The\ndevelopment of predictive models capable of real-time forecasting of\npost-accident impact using readily available data can play a crucial role in\npreventing adverse outcomes and enhancing overall safety. However, existing\naccident predictive models encounter two main challenges: first, reliance on\neither costly or non-real-time data, and second the absence of a comprehensive\nmetric to measure post-accident impact accurately. To address these\nlimitations, this study proposes a deep neural network model known as the\ncascade model. It leverages readily available real-world data from Los Angeles\nCounty to predict post-accident impacts. The model consists of two components:\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM\nmodel captures temporal patterns, while the CNN extracts patterns from the\nsparse accident dataset.

In recent years, there has been particular interest in stealing\nlarge language models (LLMs). In this paper, we aim to build a theoretical\nunderstanding of stealing language models by studying a simple and\nmathematically tractable setting. We study model stealing for Hidden Markov\nModels (HMMs), and more generally low-rank language models.\n  We assume that the learner works in the conditional query model, introduced\nby Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang. Our main result is an efficient\nalgorithm in the conditional query model, for learning any low-rank\ndistribution. In other words, our algorithm succeeds at stealing any language\nmodel whose output distribution is low-rank. This improves upon the previous\nresult by Kakade, Krishnamurthy, Mahajan and Zhang, which also requires the\nunknown distribution to have high \"fidelity\", a property that holds only in\nrestricted cases. There are two key insights behind our algorithm: First, we\nrepresent the conditional distributions at each timestep by constructing\nbarycentric spanners among a collection of vectors of exponentially large\ndimension. Second, for sampling from our representation, we iteratively solve a\nsequence of convex optimization problems that involve projection in relative\nentropy to prevent compounding of errors over the length of the sequence.

As models scale, compression techniques become essential for\nbalancing model quality with computational efficiency. Structured pruning,\nwhich removes less critical components of the model, is a promising strategy\nfor reducing complexity. However, one-shot pruning often results in significant\nquality degradation, particularly in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. To\nrecover lost quality, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is commonly applied, but it\ncan lead to catastrophic forgetting by shifting the model's learned data\ndistribution. Therefore, addressing the degradation from both pruning and SFT\nis essential to preserve the original model's quality. In this work, we utilize\nself-data distilled fine-tuning to address these challenges. Our approach\nleverages the original, unpruned model to generate a distilled dataset that\npreserves semantic richness and mitigates catastrophic forgetting by\nmaintaining alignment with the base model's knowledge.

Estimation with observational data is challenging because, while\nmembership in the target population is defined in terms of eligibility\ncriteria, treatment is rarely observed exactly at the time of eligibility.\nAd-hoc solutions to this timing misalignment can induce bias by incorrectly\nattributing prior event counts and person-time to treatment.

Open multilingual\nmodels outperform language-specific fine-tuned models, which perform only\nslightly better than random baselines. Models also perform better in high\nresource languages as compared to low resource ones. Domain-wise analysis\nindicates that models perform poorly in culturally relevant areas like Arts and\nHumanities, Law and Governance compared to general fields like STEM. To the\nbest of our knowledge, MILU is the first of its kind benchmark focused on Indic\nlanguages, serving as a crucial step towards comprehensive cultural evaluation.\nAll code, benchmarks, and artifacts are publicly available to foster open\nresearch.\n","authors":["Sshubam Verma","Mohammed Safi Ur Rahman Khan","Vishwajeet Kumar","Rudra Murthy","Jaydeep Sen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02538v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18346v4","updated":"2024-11-13T17:17:43Z","published":"2024-03-27T08:38:49Z","title":"Quantifying and Mitigating Unimodal Biases in Multimodal Large Language\n  Models: A Causal Perspective","summary":"  Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have facilitated the\ndevelopment of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs).

To investigate this issue, we propose a causal framework to\ninterpret the biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) problems. Within this\nframework, we conduct an in-depth causal analysis to assess the causal effect\nof these biases on MLLM predictions. Based on the analysis, we introduce 1) a\nnovel MORE dataset with 12,000 challenging VQA instances requiring multi-hop\nreasoning and overcoming unimodal biases. 2) a causality-enhanced agent\nframework CAVE that guides models to comprehensively integrate information from\ndifferent modalities and mitigate biases.

To address this gap, we introduce Multi-IF, a new benchmark\ndesigned to assess LLMs' proficiency in following multi-turn and multilingual\ninstructions. Multi-IF, which utilizes a hybrid framework combining LLM and\nhuman annotators, expands upon the IFEval by incorporating multi-turn sequences\nand translating the English prompts into another 7 languages, resulting in a\ndataset of 4,501 multilingual conversations, where each has three turns. Our\nevaluation of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs on Multi-IF reveals that it presents a\nsignificantly more challenging task than existing benchmarks.

At the core of this debate is how each paradigm\nensures its explanations are faithful, i.e., true to the model's behavior.

Cross-entropy builds\nup a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary\nitems and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than\nthe rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that\ncomputes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens\ninto global memory.

Often, rather than just understanding the effects of\ncauses, researchers also wish to understand how a cause $X$ affects an outcome\n$Y$ mechanistically -- i.e., what are the causal pathways that are activated\nbetween $X$ and $Y$. For analyzing such questions, a range of methods has been\ndeveloped over decades under the rubric of causal mediation analysis.\nTraditional mediation analysis focuses on decomposing the average treatment\neffect (ATE) into direct and indirect effects, and therefore focuses on the ATE\nas the central quantity. This corresponds to providing explanations for\nassociations in the interventional regime, such as when the treatment $X$ is\nrandomized. Commonly, however, it is of interest to explain associations in the\nobservational regime, and not just in the interventional regime. In this paper,\nwe introduce \\text{variation analysis}, an extension of mediation analysis that\nfocuses on the total variation (TV) measure between $X$ and $Y$, written as\n$\\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_1] - \\mathrm{E}[Y \\mid X=x_0]$. The TV measure\nencompasses both causal and confounded effects, as opposed to the ATE which\nonly encompasses causal (direct and mediated) variations.

The SpS\nfuses the functional connectivity with the distance-based connectivity\ncontaining spatial position of EEG electrodes. A multi-head-attention graph\nconvolutional network is also applied in the SpS to fuse the features from\ndifferent EEG channels. The TeS is based on long short-term memory and graph\ntransformer networks, where the temporal information of different time-windows\nis fused. Moreover, the DAL is used after the SpS to obtain the\ndomain-invariant feature. Results: Experimental results under tenfold\ncross-validation show that the proposed SAD-TIME method achieves 92.00% and\n94.00% depression classification accuracies on two datasets, respectively, in\ncross-subject mode. Conclusion: SAD-TIME is a robust depression detection\nmodel, where the automatedly-generated features, the SpS and the TeS assist the\nclassification performance with the fusion of the innate spatiotemporal\ninformation in the EEG signals.\n","authors":["Han-Guang Wang","Hui-Rang Hou","Li-Cheng Jin","Chen-Yang Xu","Zhong-Yi Zhang","Qing-Hao Meng"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08521v1.pdf","comment":"21pages, 7 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15166v2","updated":"2024-11-13T11:05:04Z","published":"2024-09-23T16:20:21Z","title":"Harmonic Path Integral Diffusion","summary":"  In this manuscript, we present a novel approach for sampling from a\ncontinuous multivariate probability distribution, which may either be\nexplicitly known (up to a normalization factor) or represented via empirical\nsamples.

Our\nframework is built on the recognized opinion formation game, where we regard\nthe opinion of each agent as a data-derived model, unlike previous works that\ntreat opinions as data-independent scalars. The opinion model for every agent\nis initially learned from its local samples and evolves game-theoretically as\nall agents communicate with neighbors and revise their models towards an\nequilibrium. Our focus is on the sample complexity needed to ensure that the\nopinions converge to an equilibrium such that the final model of every agent\nhas low generalization error.\n  Our paper has two main technical results. First, we present a novel\npolynomial time optimization framework to quantify the total sample complexity\nfor arbitrary networks, when the underlying learning problem is (generalized)\nlinear regression. Second, we leverage this optimization to study the network\ngain which measures the improvement of sample complexity when learning over a\nnetwork compared to that in isolation. Towards this end, we derive network gain\nbounds for various network classes including cliques, star graphs, and random\nregular graphs. Additionally, our framework provides a method to study sample\ndistribution within the network, suggesting that it is sufficient to allocate\nsamples inversely to the degree. Empirical results on both synthetic and\nreal-world networks strongly support our theoretical findings.\n","authors":["Haolin Liu","Rajmohan Rajaraman","Ravi Sundaram","Anil Vullikanti","Omer Wasim","Haifeng Xu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02349v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08286v1","updated":"2024-11-13T02:02:52Z","published":"2024-11-13T02:02:52Z","title":"Hashing for Protein Structure Similarity Search","summary":"  Protein structure similarity search (PSSS), which tries to search proteins\nwith similar structures, plays a crucial role across diverse domains from drug\ndesign to protein function prediction and molecular evolution.

Cross-entropy builds\nup a logit matrix with entries for each pair of input tokens and vocabulary\nitems and, for small models, consumes an order of magnitude more memory than\nthe rest of the LLM combined. We propose Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a method that\ncomputes the cross-entropy loss without materializing the logits for all tokens\ninto global memory.

Taking the\nGemma 2 (2B) model as an example, CCE reduces the memory footprint of the loss\ncomputation from 24 GB to 1 MB, and the total training-time memory consumption\nof the classifier head from 28 GB to 1 GB.

The attention head can\nsimultaneously delete, copy, or retain tokens by assigning them negative,\npositive, or minimal attention weights, respectively. As a result, a single\nattention head becomes more flexible and expressive. (2) Cog Attention improves\nthe model's robustness against representational collapse, which can occur when\nearlier tokens are over-squashed into later positions, leading to homogeneous\nrepresentations. Negative weights reduce effective information paths from\nearlier to later tokens, helping to mitigate this issue. We develop\nTransformer-like models which use Cog Attention as attention modules, including\ndecoder-only models for language modeling and U-ViT diffusion models for image\ngeneration.

This paper is dedicated\nto simulating human learning to address the shortcomings of instance training,\nfocusing on instruction learning to enhance cross-task generalization. Within\nthis context, we introduce Task Adapters Generation from Instructions (TAGI),\nwhich automatically constructs the task-specific model in a parameter\ngeneration manner based on the given task instructions without retraining for\nunseen tasks. Specifically, we utilize knowledge distillation to enhance the\nconsistency between TAGI developed through Learning with Instruction and\ntask-specific models developed through Training with Instance, by aligning the\nlabels, output logits, and adapter parameters between them. TAGI is endowed\nwith cross-task generalization capabilities through a two-stage training\nprocess that includes hypernetwork pretraining and finetuning.

This raises an intriguing question:\ncan the capabilities of LLMs be harnessed to further improve multimodal\nrepresentation learning? The potential benefits of incorporating LLMs into CLIP\nare clear. LLMs' strong textual understanding can fundamentally improve CLIP's\nability to handle image captions, drastically enhancing its ability to process\nlong and complex texts, a well-known limitation of vanilla CLIP. Moreover, LLMs\nare trained on a vast corpus of text, possessing open-world knowledge.

This obscures the\ndirection of improvement and highlights the lack of a robust theoretical\nanalysis regarding similarity and diversity constraints in retrieval processes.\nTo address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach that\ncharacterizes both constraints through the relationship between the sum vector\nand the query vector. The proximity of these vectors ensures the similarity\nconstraint, while requiring individual vectors within the sum vector to diverge\nin their alignment with the query vector satisfies the diversity constraint. We\nfirst formulate a new combinatorial optimization problem, selecting k vectors\nfrom a candidate set such that their sum vector maximally aligns with the query\nvector, and demonstrate that this problem is NP-complete. This result\nunderscores the inherent difficulty of simultaneously achieving similarity and\ndiversity in vector retrieval, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for\nfuture research. Subsequently, we present the heuristic algorithm Vectors\nRetrieval with Similarity and Diversity, VRSD, which features a clear\noptimization objective and eliminates the need for preset parameters.

Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted\napproach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and\npowder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical\nprocesses taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds.

Given samples from an unknown language,\nthe trained model should produce valid strings not seen in training and be\nexpressive enough to capture the language's full richness. Otherwise,\noutputting invalid strings constitutes \"hallucination,\" and failing to capture\nthe full range leads to \"mode collapse.\" We ask if a language model can meet\nboth requirements.\n  We investigate this within a statistical language generation setting building\non Gold and Angluin. Here, the model receives random samples from a\ndistribution over an unknown language K, which belongs to a possibly infinite\ncollection of languages. The goal is to generate unseen strings from K. We say\nthe model generates from K with consistency and breadth if, as training size\nincreases, its output converges to all unseen strings in K.\n  Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] asked if consistency and breadth in\nlanguage generation are possible. We answer this negatively: for a large class\nof language models, including next-token prediction models, this is impossible\nfor most collections of candidate languages. This contrasts with [KM24]'s\nresult, showing consistent generation without breadth is possible for any\ncountable collection of languages. Our finding highlights that generation with\nbreadth fundamentally differs from generation without breadth.\n  As a byproduct, we establish near-tight bounds on the number of samples\nneeded for generation with or without breadth.\n  Finally, our results offer hope: consistent generation with breadth is\nachievable for any countable collection of languages when negative examples\n(strings outside K) are available alongside positive ones.

Such a design is inspired by the\ntheoretically derived correlation between patch size and diffusion restoration\nerror that is generalized across diverse patch attack scenarios. Finally,\nDiffPAD applies inpainting techniques to the original input images with the\nestimated patch region being masked. By integrating closed-form solutions for\nsuper-resolution restoration and image inpainting into the conditional reverse\nsampling process of a pre-trained diffusion model, DiffPAD obviates the need\nfor text guidance or fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that DiffPAD not only achieves state-of-the-art adversarial\nrobustness against patch attacks but also excels in recovering naturalistic\nimages without patch remnants.

However, these data-driven\nmodels heavily rely on pre-existing in-distribution data for training, limiting\ntheir performance when confronted with fake news from emerging or previously\nunseen domains, known as out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Tackling OOD fake news\nis a challenging yet critical task. In this paper, we introduce the Causal\nSubgraph-oriented Domain Adaptive Fake News Detection (CSDA) model, designed to\nenhance zero-shot fake news detection by extracting causal substructures from\npropagation graphs using in-distribution data and generalising this approach to\nOOD data. The model employs a graph neural network based mask generation\nprocess to identify dominant nodes and edges within the propagation graph,\nusing these substructures for fake news detection. Additionally, the\nperformance of CSDA is further improved through contrastive learning in\nfew-shot scenarios, where a limited amount of OOD data is available for\ntraining. Extensive experiments on public social media datasets demonstrate\nthat CSDA effectively handles OOD fake news detection, achieving a 7 to 16\npercents accuracy improvement over other state-of-the-art models.\n","authors":["Shuzhi Gong","Richard O.

Our results show that, even with the use of\nChains of Thought (CoT) prompts, mainstream LLMs, including the latest o1 model\n(noted for its reasoning capabilities), have a high error rate when solving\nthese modified CRT problems. Specifically, the average accuracy rate dropped by\nup to 50% compared to the original questions.Further analysis of LLMs'\nincorrect answers suggests that they primarily rely on pattern matching from\ntheir training data, which aligns more with human intuition (System 1 thinking)\nrather than with human-like reasoning (System 2 thinking). This finding\nchallenges the belief that LLMs have genuine mathematical reasoning abilities\ncomparable to humans. As a result, this work may adjust overly optimistic views\non LLMs' progress towards artificial general intelligence.\n","authors":["Wei Xie","Shuoyoucheng Ma","Zhenhua Wang","Enze Wang","Kai Chen","Xiaobing Sun","Baosheng Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14979v4.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21862v2","updated":"2024-11-14T09:17:31Z","published":"2024-10-29T08:56:29Z","title":"Hierarchical mixtures of Unigram models for short text clustering: the\n  role of Beta-Liouville priors","summary":"  This paper presents a variant of the Multinomial mixture model tailored for\nthe unsupervised classification of short text data.

We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our method across both synthetic and real-world datasets,\noutperforming existing methods in terms of reliability and accuracy. Our method\nfills a critical gap in the evaluation of time series generative models,\noffering a tool that is both practical and adaptable to high-stakes\napplications.\n","authors":["Aoran Zhang","Wenbin Zhou","Liyan Xie","Shixiang Zhu"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13986v2.pdf","comment":"27 pages, 4 figures"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09678v1","updated":"2024-11-14T18:44:31Z","published":"2024-11-14T18:44:31Z","title":"NeuralDEM -- Real-time Simulation of Industrial Particulate Flows","summary":"  Advancements in computing power have made it possible to numerically simulate\nlarge-scale fluid-mechanical and/or particulate systems, many of which are\nintegral to core industrial processes. Among the different numerical methods\navailable, the discrete element method (DEM) provides one of the most accurate\nrepresentations of a wide range of physical systems involving granular and\ndiscontinuous materials. Consequently, DEM has become a widely accepted\napproach for tackling engineering problems connected to granular flows and\npowder mechanics. Additionally, DEM can be integrated with grid-based\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods, enabling the simulation of chemical\nprocesses taking place, e.g., in fluidized beds. However, DEM is\ncomputationally intensive because of the intrinsic multiscale nature of\nparticulate systems, restricting simulation duration or number of particles.\nTowards this end, NeuralDEM presents an end-to-end approach to replace slow\nnumerical DEM routines with fast, adaptable deep learning surrogates. NeuralDEM\nis capable of picturing long-term transport processes across different regimes\nusing macroscopic observables without any reference to microscopic model\nparameters. First, NeuralDEM treats the Lagrangian discretization of DEM as an\nunderlying continuous field, while simultaneously modeling macroscopic behavior\ndirectly as additional auxiliary fields. Second, NeuralDEM introduces\nmulti-branch neural operators scalable to real-time modeling of\nindustrially-sized scenarios - from slow and pseudo-steady to fast and\ntransient. Such scenarios have previously posed insurmountable challenges for\ndeep learning models. Notably, NeuralDEM faithfully models coupled CFD-DEM\nfluidized bed reactors of 160k CFD cells and 500k DEM particles for\ntrajectories of 28s. NeuralDEM will open many new doors to advanced engineering\nand much faster process cycles.\n","authors":["Benedikt Alkin","Tobias Kronlachner","Samuele Papa","Stefan Pirker","Thomas Lichtenegger","Johannes Brandstetter"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09678v1.pdf","comment":"Project page: https://nx-ai.github.io/NeuralDEM/"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09267v1","updated":"2024-11-14T08:08:25Z","published":"2024-11-14T08:08:25Z","title":"Towards efficient compression and communication for prototype-based\n  decentralized learning","summary":"  In prototype-based federated learning, the exchange of model parameters\nbetween clients and the master server is replaced by transmission of prototypes\nor quantized versions of the data samples to the aggregation server. A fully\ndecentralized deployment of prototype-based learning, without a central\nagregartor of prototypes, is more robust upon network failures and reacts\nfaster to changes in the statistical distribution of the data, suggesting\npotential advantages and quick adaptation in dynamic learning tasks, e.g., when\nthe data sources are IoT devices or when data is non-iid. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem of designing a communication-efficient decentralized\nlearning system based on prototypes. We address the challenge of prototype\nredundancy by leveraging on a twofold data compression technique, i.e., sending\nonly update messages if the prototypes are informationtheoretically useful (via\nthe Jensen-Shannon distance), and using clustering on the prototypes to\ncompress the update messages used in the gossip protocol. We also use parallel\ninstead of sequential gossiping, and present an analysis of its\nage-of-information (AoI). Our experimental results show that, with these\nimprovements, the communications load can be substantially reduced without\ndecreasing the convergence rate of the learning algorithm.\n","authors":["Pablo Fernández-Piñeiro","Manuel Ferández-Veiga","Rebeca P.

To addressing this challenge, we propose GRAINRec: a Graph\nand Attention Integrated session-based recommendation model that generates\nrecommendations in real-time. Our scope of work is item recommendations in\nonline retail where a session is defined as an ordered sequence of digital\nguest actions, such as page views or adds to cart. The proposed model generates\nrecommendations by considering the importance of all items in the session\ntogether, letting us predict relevant recommendations dynamically as the\nsession evolves. We also propose a heuristic approach to implement real-time\ninferencing that meets Target platform's service level agreement (SLA). The\nproposed architecture lets us predict relevant recommendations dynamically as\nthe session evolves, rather than relying on pre-computed recommendations for\neach item. Evaluation results of the proposed model show an average improvement\nof 1.5% across all offline evaluation metrics.
